# Random_Testing_Framework


## Description
This project is a **Random Testing Framework** that automates the process of generating random inputs for various data types and running tests on functions to verify their correctness. The framework supports testing for multiple data types like integers, strings, arrays, booleans, and floating-point numbers. The results are stored in the `data_types` folder under `test_results` for easy access and analysis.
